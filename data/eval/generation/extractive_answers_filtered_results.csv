Unfortunately, the provided context doesn't contain information about share repurchases and dividends in Q1 2021 (Q3 FY2021). Therefore, I cannot answer your question directly. 

However, I can offer some alternative approaches to find the answer:

**1. Consult Microsoft's Q1 2021 Earnings Report:**

The most reliable source for this information would be Microsoft's official Q1 2021 earnings report. This report typically includes a detailed breakdown of cash flows, including share repurchases and dividend payments. You can find the report on Microsoft's Investor Relations website: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/

**2. Search for News Articles:**

Financial news websites and publications often cover major corporate events like share repurchases and dividend announcements. You can try searching for news articles about Microsoft's Q1 2021 earnings or dividend announcements to see if any mention the amount returned to shareholders.

**3. Use Financial Databases:**

Financial databases like Bloomberg or Reuters may also provide information about share repurchases and dividends. These databases often track this data for publicly traded companies.

**4. Contact Microsoft Investor Relations:**

If you're still unable to find the information you need, you can try contacting Microsoft Investor Relations directly. They may be able to provide you with the specific figures you're looking for.

**Comparison to Previous Year:**

Once you have the amount of share repurchases and dividends for Q1 2021, you can calculate the percentage change compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year (Q1 2020). To do this, use the following formula:

```
(Amount in Q1 2021 - Amount in Q1 2020) / Amount in Q1 2020 * 100
```

This will give you the percentage increase or decrease in share repurchases and dividends from the previous year.

However, it does not provide the specific amount returned to shareholders in Q1 2021 (Q3 FY2021) as requested in the question.
