* **Q3 2021:** $105.960 billion
* **Increase:** $18.616 billion
* **Percentage increase:** 17.57%

**2. Technology and Content Costs within Operating Expenses:**

Unfortunately, the provided context doesn't explicitly break down operating expenses into specific categories like technology and content. However, we can make an educated guess based on the information available:

* **AWS Segment:** This segment directly represents Amazon's cloud computing services, which heavily rely on technology and content infrastructure.
* **North America and International Segments:** These segments likely include technology and content costs associated with e-commerce operations, such as website development, data centers, and digital content licensing.

**Estimated Technology and Content Costs:**

* **Q3 2022:** 
    * AWS Operating Expenses: $15.135 billion
    * Assuming a conservative estimate of 20% of North America and International operating expenses for technology and content: 
        * North America: $79.255 billion * 20% = $15.851 billion
        * International: $30.186 billion * 20% = $6.037 billion

        * North America: $64.677 billion * 20% = $12.935 billion
        * International: $30.056 billion * 20% = $6.011 billion
    * Total Estimated Technology and Content Costs: $11.227 billion (AWS) + $12.935 billion (North America) + $6.011 billion (International) = $30.173 billion
* **Increase:** $37.023 billion (Q3 2022) - $30.173 billion (Q3 2021) = $6.85 billion
* **Percentage increase:** ($6.85 billion / $30.173 billion) * 100% = 22.71%

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available information, Amazon's spending on technology and content in Q3 2022 likely increased by approximately $6.85 billion or 22.71% compared to Q3 2021. This increase can be attributed to the growth of the AWS segment and continued investments in technology and content across other segments.
